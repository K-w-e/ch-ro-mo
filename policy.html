          What Are Cookies
          <br><br>
            As is common practice with
            almost all professional websites
            this site uses cookies, which are
            tiny files that are downloaded to
            your computer, to improve your
            experience. This page describes
            what information they gather, how
            we use it and why we sometimes
            need to store these cookies. We
            will also share how you can prevent
            these cookies from being stored
            however this may downgrade or
            ‘break’ certain elements of the sites
            functionality.
          <br><br><br>
            In general, a cookie is a small text
            file that is stored by the computer
            when a website is visited by a
            user. The text stores information
            that the site is able to read in the
            moment in which it is seen at a later
            time. Some of these cookies are
            necessary for the proper operation
            of the site; others are useful to the
            visitor because they can safely
            store such information as the user
            name.

            How We Use Cookies
            <br><br>
            We use cookies for a variety
            of reasons detailed below.
            Unfortunately in most cases
            there are no industry standard
            options for disabling cookies
            without completely disabling the
            functionality and features they add
            to this site. It is recommended that
            you leave on all cookies if you are
            not sure whether you need them or
            not in case they are used to provide
            a service that you use.
            <br><br>
            Disabling Cookies
            <br><br>
            You can prevent the setting of
            cookies by adjusting the settings

            functionality of this and many other
            websites that you visit. Disabling
            cookies will usually result in also
            disabling certain functionality and
            features of the this site. Therefore
            it is recommended that you do not
            disable cookies.
