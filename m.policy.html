            <hr /> What Are Cookies
            <br><br> As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are tiny
            files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information
            they gather, how we use
            it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies
            from being stored however this may downgrade or ‘break’ certain elements of the sites functionality.
            <br><br> In general, a cookie is a small text file that is stored by the computer when a website is visited
            by a user. The text stores information that the site is able to read in the moment in which it is seen at a
            later time. Some of these
            cookies are necessary for the proper operation of the site; others are useful to the visitor because they
            can safely store such information as the user name.
            <br><br> How We Use Cookies We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most
            cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the
            functionality and features they add
            to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or
            not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.
            <br><br>
